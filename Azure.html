<p1>Companies can use a public cloud computing platform like Azure, AWS and Google Platform which purchases and maintains all the computing hardware. This means companies can effectively “rent” hardware resources as needed.
    Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform are two of the top competitors to AWS.

<h2>Azure</h2>
<p1>Microsoft Azure is a broad, ever-expanding set of cloud-based computing services that are available to businesses, developers, government agencies, and anyone who wants to build an app or run an enterprise on the internet without having to install and manage hardware or server software. 
    Microsoft manages the physical storage of data for Azure users, which means it will be stored in one or more of Microsoft’s 100+ datacentres around the globe.
    Azure can be utilized at any scale, from a garage start-up to a Fortune 500 company. Because of the ease of transition, organizations with an existing Windows Server deployment may find Azure to be best suited to their needs.
    </p1>
 <hr><h2>Amazon Web services</h2></hr>
<p1>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 175 fully featured services from data centres globally.
    AWS offers services relevant to any organization, large or small, with an internet presence or a need for private data storage and retrieval.
    </p1>

<hr><h2>Google Cloud</h2></hr>
<p1>Google Cloud Platform, as the name implies, is a cloud computing platform that provides infrastructure tools and services for users to build applications and services.
    Google Cloud Platform is regarded as the third biggest cloud provider in terms of revenue behind AWS in first place and Microsoft Azure in second.
    All organizations in need of cloud computing should consider Google Cloud Platform for their needs especially SMBs (small and medium-sized business), which the platform was aimed towards.
