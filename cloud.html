<p1>Cloud computing has many benefits. For one, it works on a pay-for-use basis. This means that you only pay for resources that you are using and only spend exactly as much as you need, not a penny more. Secondly, something that is very appealing is the elasticity of the resources. You can increase or decrease your usage any time you want depending of your need of that resource. A third aspect of cloud computing is that services previously provided by IT administrators will be accessible to any user at any time. </p1>
<br>
<p1>Here are some of the main uses of cloud computing:</p1>

<div style="overflow-x:auto;">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Use</th>
      <br> <br>
      <th>Explanation</th>
      
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>File storage</td>
      <td>This feature allows users to store files online which would be accessible from any device and from anywhere. This feature is useful for individual users as well as large scale companies. In the case of large amounts of data, companies would only pay for the amount of storage they are taking up without having to maintain the physical infrastructure needed to store that data.
</td>
     
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Backup</td>
      
      <td>Manually backing up data, especially in large amounts, can be very tedious (dull). Furthermore, it is prone to errors and malfunctions which would make this practice very unreliable. Limited space and time consumption were some of the main factors for which manual data backup was abandoned.</td>

  <hr><h2>Cloud Services</h2</hr>
<br> <hr>
  <h3>Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)</h3>
<p1>Cloud computing can be broken down into three cloud computing models. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) refers to the fundamental building blocks of computing that can be rented: physical or virtual servers, storage and networking. This is attractive to companies that want to build applications from the very ground up and want to control nearly all the elements themselves, but it does require firms to have the technical skills to be able to orchestrate services at that level. Research by Oracle found that two thirds of IaaS users said using online infrastructure makes it easier to innovate, had cut their time to deploy new applications and services and had significantly cut on-going maintenance costs. However, half said IaaS isn't secure enough for most critical data.</p1>
<br><hr>
<h3>Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)</h3>
<p1>Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) is the next layer up as well as the underlying storage, networking, and virtual servers this will also include the tools and software that developers need to build applications on top of: that could include middleware, database management, operating systems, and development tools.</p1>
  <hr>
<h3>Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)</h3>
<p1>Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is the delivery of applications-as-a-service, probably the version of cloud computing that most people are used to on a day-to-day basis. The underlying hardware and operating system is irrelevant to the end user, who will access the service via a web browser or app; it is often bought on a per-seat or per-user basis.</p1>

<br><br>
<hr><h2>Types of Cloud</h2></hr>
<br><hr>
<h3>Public cloud</h3>
<p1>Public cloud is the classic cloud computing model, where users can access a large pool of computing power over the internet (whether that is IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS). One of the significant benefits here is the ability to rapidly scale a service. The cloud computing suppliers have vast amounts of computing power, which they share out between a large numbers of customers the 'multi-tenant' architecture. Their huge scale means they have enough spare capacity that they can easily cope if any particular customer needs more resources, which is why it is often used for less-sensitive applications that demand a varying amount of resources.</p1>
<br><hr>
<h3>Private Cloud</h3>
<p1>Private cloud allows organizations to benefit from the some of the advantages of public cloud but without the concerns about relinquishing control over data and services, because it is tucked away behind the corporate firewall. Companies can control exactly where their data is being held and can build the infrastructure in a way they want largely for IaaS or PaaS projects to give developers access to a pool of computing power that scales on-demand without putting security at risk. However, that additional security comes at a cost, as few companies will have the scale of AWS, Microsoft or Google, which means they will not be able to create the same economies of scale. Still, for companies that require additional security, private cloud may be a useful stepping stone, helping them to understand cloud services or rebuild internal applications for the cloud, before shifting them into the public cloud.</p1>
<br><hr>
<h3>Hybrid Cloud</h3>
<p1>Hybrid cloud is perhaps where everyone is in reality: a bit of this, a bit of that. Some data in the public cloud, some projects in private cloud, multiple vendors and different levels of cloud usage. According to research by TechRepublic, the main reasons for choosing hybrid cloud include disaster recovery planning and the desire to avoid hardware costs when expanding their existing data centre.</p1>
